# JavaScript Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## The challenge

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it!

All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

The task required to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [provided dataset](UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. 

We only use pure `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`, and `D3.js` on our web pages.

## Tasks completed

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

Write [JavaScript code](UFO-level-1/static/js/app.js) that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

I wrote:
* [JavaScript code - using multiple `input` tags](UFO-level-2-Input_filter_method/static/js/app.js) and
* [JavaScript code - using multiple `select` dropdowns](UFO-level-2-Select_filter_method/static/js/app.js)

so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
- - -
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
- - -
